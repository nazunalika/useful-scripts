# useful-scripts
Scripts that I have either written or gathered elsewhere (with some modifications) for work or home.

Usually contains the following:

  => LDAP Scripts
  
  => Work-related Scripts that get me by almost daily
  
  => Scripts to setup Fedora/CentOS Machines
  
  => Misc things that I found fun
