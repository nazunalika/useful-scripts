# freeipa

These scripts are for freeipa. In particular, solaris. You will need to use this library: https://github.com/opennode/python-freeipa

For Solaris 10, you will need to use OpenCSW python 2.7 and use that pip. Majority of these scripts are bash with only small bits done in python. In the future, it will eventually be full python.
